Statement of Purpose:
Banks are an integral part of society for obvious reasons and credit score is an important metric that can determine the trajectory of oneâ€™s life. This score is used to determine whether to offer you loans, mortgage, etc.; sometimes this score is used to choose people for jobs! This team aims to predict credit default with the aid of machine learning and data processing techniques. Our methodology includes performing an ablation study to evaluate the effectiveness, as assessed by AUC, of a machine learning model trained on a dataset with processed features in comparison to two benchmarks: the identical model architecture trained on unprocessed data and a traditional credit score approach. This comparative analysis aims to elucidate the impact of data processing techniques on improving the predictive capabilities of machine learning models in predicting credit defaults. Our objective is to contribute to the comprehension of how advanced data processing may result in more precise risk assessments within the realm of financial lending.
