Welcome to Risknet! This is a downloadable Pip package where you can access and run an XGBoost pipeline.

To access the Risknet package, you can download it by running `pip install risknet`. You can find documentation here: https://pypi.org/project/risknet/1.0.17/
To access the Risknet code, fork the code from the Git repo.

# Folder/File Layout Layout
- src/risknet
   - `config`: holds `conf.yaml`
      - `conf.yaml`: helps with setup
      - `handlers.py`
   - `data`: empty folder where user can store FM dataset
   - `jobs`
      - `cloud_etl.py`: helps save files to cloud
   - `proc`: contains preprocessing steps like feature encoding, label prep, and train-test splits
      - `encoder.py`: feature engineering/encoding categoricals
      - `label_prep.py`: defines default, progress on loan
      - `reducer.py`: reduces features based on importance, also train/test/val splits
   -`run`: contains files for running pipeline
      - `main.py`: currently empty. WIP define pipeline as a function and call here
      - `model.py`: defines the model class + functions
      - `pipeline.py`: calls functions to execute the pipeline
   - `sys`: contains files to set up system environment and logging
      - `log.py`: sets up logger
      - `managers.py`: sets up the dask manager
      - `system.py`: defines creating and removing files via the `sys` package
   -`main.py`: logs start, stop time for running the program (including downloading packages from setup.cfg)
   - `tests`: store tests here
      -`test_stub.py`: currently only asserts True == True. No tests added yet.

# Running The Code
Currently, this code is hosted on testpypi, a Test version of the Python Packaging Index. You can see package documentation [here](https://test.pypi.org/project/risknet/).

As described in the website above, you can access the code by running `pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ risknet` on your local computer. Ensure pip is updated.
- Note: this code might not work on your computer as many dependencies of the package like pandas are not available for download via testpypi

To run a specific part of the code, use risknet.utils.{feature_name} as is standard practice when accessing Python packages.

# Reproducibility Information:
## Accessing Data
You may want to access our base dataset for reference purposes. Here's how you can do that:

In this study we will use the Freddie Mac Single-Family Loan Dataset to run code. Specifically, we will use the 2009_Q1 dataset.
1. Go to this link [here](https://www.freddiemac.com/research/datasets/sf-loanlevel-dataset). This will redirect you to the Freddie Mac site.
2. Scroll down until you reach a table that says "Loan-Level Dataset Files". Download the **standard quarterly** dataset.
3. Submit necessary education credentials including name, email, and reason for accessing the files. There should not be a payment step. The site will email you a username and password.
4. Reload the page and log in with your new email/password credentials.
5. Download the Quarter 1 data from the year 2009. You will receive a .zip file in your Downloads folder. 

If you unzip the file, you will see multiple files including a "date_time" file and a "data" file.
6. Save these files into the src/data folder in a local copy of this repository

## Dependencies
You can find a list of this package's dependencies inside the file called `setup.cfg`.

In summary, the downloads needed for this code are:
- numpy==1.26.1
- pandas==2.1.2
- dask[complete]==2023.10.1
- xgboost==2.0.1
- PyYAML
- types-PyYAML
- pyarrow
- fastparquet
- pytest
- pytest-cov
- mypy
- flake8

# Steps to Update Version on TestPyPi
To update the version:
1. Reset the code from the previous version (if necessary)
- `rm -rf dist build` to remove build folder
- manually remove the "risknet.egg-info" folder. This will change `src` to `src/risknet`.
2. Update setup.cfg's version number depending on if major, minor, or bug change
3. Rerun `python3 -m build` (you should get a new dist folder + egg folder in \src)
   - THIS SHOULD CREATE A NEW binary file where version is UPDATED
   - Make sure you're in the same directory as your setup.cfg when you run this command.
4. Rerun `python3 -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*`
   - Username: `__token__`
   - Password: [testpypi password starting with pypi]
   - If you did NOT update the version # before running `build` then you will get an error

# When Uploading to PyPi:
Repeat steps above with these important differences:
- Use `python3 -m twine upload dist/*` to upload to PyPi. You do not need to specify `--repository testpypi` when uploading to PyPi.
- Login username will be the same. However, remember to use PyPi's login password/API token, **not** TestPyPi's token for the password.

# Package Version History Documentation:
0.0.1: Ran into problems with installing pytest-cov

0.0.2: Got error:
`ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement dask[complete] (from risknet) (from versions: none) ERROR: No matching distribution found for dask[complete]`

0.0.3: Tried moving dask into [options.extras_require] not install_requires. Got error for flake8

0.0.4: Commented out more packages.
Got error: `error: package directory 'lib3/yaml' does not exist` and `metadata-generation-failed`.

0.0.5: Moved types-YAML into options, still get `'lib3/yaml does not exist'` error :/

0.0.6: we're removing YAML as a test
Got error `ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement typing (from risknet) (from versions: none) ERROR: No matching distribution found for typing`

0.0.10: reverting to version 0.0.6, checking if it works --success! But still error `No matching distribution found for typing`

0.0.11: what happens when we remove typing (since it's part of stdlib in python >3.5)?

0.0.12: commented out all packages added by EC

0.0.13: Got new error:
`ERROR: Cannot install pandas==1.3.4 and risknet==0.0.12 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    risknet 0.0.12 depends on numpy
    pandas 1.3.4 depends on numpy>=1.17.3; platform_machine != "aarch64" and platform_machine != "arm64" and python_version < "3.10"`

Solution: will try setting python > 3.10

**SUCCESS! Version 0.0.13 can download from emily's (base)**
Caveats:
- Probably can only work because it has all dependencies already installed in the env (it threw an error when I tried to run it in risknet_test)
- Can only import `risknet.utils.label_prep` since `risknet.utils.encoder`, etc. have local imports to different .py files which Python can't read (??)
But Running `>>> import risknet.utils.label_prep as label_prep, >>> label_prep.label_proc(fm_root, data)` works!!

0.0.14: change setup.py to `if __name__ == "__main__: setup()`.

0.0.16: try compiling on base environment (python 3.12, pip 23.2)

1.0.17: Uploading to PyPi as risknet! SUCCESS!! :D"
